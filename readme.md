Adds a Gutenberg block to add custom p5.js code in your pages and preview it as you edit.

This plugin is similar to [Mark Uraine's p5js block](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-p5js-block/), and is in fact reverse engineered from it, although very little of the actual code is reused (see [mapk/p5js-block](https://github.com/mapk/p5js-block)). I was prompted to develop this plugin due to encountering bugs, lack of display options, and mostly the lack of updates and support for this original plugin. I feel like it should be easier to insert p5.js artworks into Wordpress websites and blogs, and this is my contribution to it (although it may very well be buggy, but I try my best. Feel free to open an issue or a pull request).
